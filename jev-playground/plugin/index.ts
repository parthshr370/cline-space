const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `Ask System One for bounded Jev judgments, or set up a Jev playground for people to explore. Usual call: fill flat fields and the tool builds the request. facts: the situation in plain words. questions: a list, one item per judgment, each with id, type, and question. type noul returns P(yes) from 0 to 1; yes_means and no_means are optional. type choice picks one option; options is REQUIRED, 2 to 255 items of {name, meaning}. type score places the answer on a scale; levels is REQUIRED, 2 to 10 labels ordered lowest first. Playground: when the user wants to explore, try what-ifs, tweak numbers, hand this to someone, or asks for a UI or page, set playground true, bucket to a short name, and about to one plain sentence saying what the playground helps decide. Give inputs instead of facts. The tool saves the bucket, opens the playground in the browser, and returns its URL without asking Jev; people who are not technical then edit the fields and questions there and press Ask Jev, so keep everything simple and in everyday words. Inputs: 3 to 6 fields, each {label, value, hint}; label is a short everyday name (Monthly rent), value is a short realistic sample (40,000 rupees), hint says in a few words what to put there (What you pay each month). Questions: 2 or 3 short questions a friend would ask, ideally one yes/no (noul), one pick-one (choice), and one scale (score); option names and levels are plain words like Rent and invest or Low, not snake_case keys; no jargon. When the user pastes a Jev request or a filled template, copy it unchanged into request_json and leave facts and questions out; both this flat shape and the raw System One shape (state plus a questions map with instructions and criteria) are accepted, with or without playground. When the user wants a template to fill in themselves, give them this flat example input with their own facts, questions, options, and levels, never a mix of the two shapes: ${JSON.stringify(EXAMPLE_INPUT)}`;

const PLAYGROUND_NOTE = "The playground is open in the browser. The user edits the input fields and questions there and presses Ask Jev; no answers exist yet, so do not report any numbers.";

const RULE_TEXT = `Use ask_jev when the user explicitly requests a calibrated judgment, routing decision, classification, or Jev or System One call. When the user wants to explore, try what-ifs, tweak inputs, share with someone, or asks for a UI, call ask_jev with playground true to open the Jev playground instead of asking once. Do not activate this rule for every prompt or treat every prompt as a classification. The tool uses exactly three primitives: noul returns the probability of yes from 0 to 1; choice selects one of 2 to 255 named options and returns the option probabilities; score returns a probability-weighted position across 2 to 10 ordered levels. Question ids are code keys and are never sent to the model, so put every part of the meaning in the question text. A noul value of 0.5 means even odds, not medium intensity. Answers arrive as numbers and must never be invented. If the tool is unavailable, say so instead of answering in prose.`;

The tool uses exactly three primitives: noul returns the probability of yes from 0 to 1; choice selects one of 2 to 255 named options and returns the option probabilities; score returns a probability-weighted position across 2 to 10 ordered levels. Question ids are code keys and are never sent to the model, so put every part of the meaning in the question text. A noul value of 0.5 means even odds, not medium intensity. Ask several focused questions rather than one broad question; every question sees the same facts and they run in parallel. Reply with the envelope the tool returned, and nothing else. Never invent numbers. If the tool fails, say so instead of answering in prose.`;
